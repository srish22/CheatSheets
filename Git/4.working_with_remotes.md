# Working with remotes

## 1. `What is remote?`
Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.

## 2. `git remote`
View remote repositories
If youâ€™ve cloned your repository, you should at least see origin, that is the default name Git gives to the server you cloned from
You can also specify -v, which shows you the URLs that Git has stored for the shortname to be used when reading and writing to that remote
If you have more than one remote, the command lists them all. 
For example, a repository with multiple remotes for working with several collaborators


## 2. `git remote add <name> <repository-url>`
git clone command implicitly adds the origin remote for you.
To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname you can reference easily, run above command

## 3. `git fetch <remote name>`
Fetch changes from a remote repository
You can use the remote name on the command line instead of the whole URL

## 4. `git fetch <remote> <branch>`
Pull changes from a remote repository and particular branch

## 5. `git pull <remote> <branch>`
Pull changes from a remote repository and merge

## 6. `git fetch <remote> <branch>`
Push changes to a remote repository
